      <h1>CODE</h1>
        <h2>CODE</h2>
        <h3>By Charles Petzold</h3>

        <p>The following are guided reading questions:
          Chapters 1-10 describes basic concepts and history building up to digital logic. <br />

Chapter 11<br />
1. Briefly describe the four gates explained in Chapter 11. Describe the behavior of each gate based on the input values to the gate.<br />
<br />
A:  
AND gate: an AND gate is a gate where at least two relays are connected in sequence and in such a way that in order for the gate to give off a charge, each switch on each of the relays must be on.  <br />
OR gate: an OR gate is a gate where at least two relays are connected to an output in parallel and in such a way that if any of the switches on any of the relays are on  it will give off a charge. <br /> 
NOR gate: a NOR gate is a gate where at least two relays are connected in sequence and such a way that if any of the switches on any of the relays are on, the gate will not give off a charge. Meaning that in order for the gate to give off a charge, both relays must be off.<br />
NAND: a NAND gate is a gate where at least two relays are connected in parallel and in such a way that if any one of the switches on the relay is off, it will give off a charge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 12<br />
1. A half adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?<br />
<br />
A:  There are 4 components (2 OR gates, a NAND gate, and an AND gate), or 2 components (XOR gate, and an AND gate) depending on how you count them. There is a total of 2 user inputs, the switches, and 2 outputs, the lights.<br />
<br />
2. A full adder is built from how many "sub components" and has how many inputs and outputs?<br />
<br />
A: A full adder is built from 9 components (5 OR gates, 2 NAND gates, and 2 AND gates), 5 components (2 XOR gates, 2AND gates, and 1 OR gate), or 3 components (2 Half-Adders, and 1 OR gate), depending on how you count it. There is a total of 3 inputs and 2 outputs<br />
<br />
3.How many total inputs and outputs are there for an 8-bit adding circuit?<br />
<br />
A: There are 17 inputs including the carry, and 9 outputs, including the carry.<br />
<br />
4. How many total transistors are needed for the ripple version of the 8-bit adder?<br />
<br />
A: 144 transistors are needed.
