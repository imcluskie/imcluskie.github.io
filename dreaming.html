            <h2>Dreaming In Code </h2>
            <h3>By Scott Rosenberg</h3>
    
            <p>The following are guided reading questions:<br />
                    Chapter 0<br />

                   2. Programmers start counting at what number?<br />
                    A: Zero<br />
                    3. What was the original sense of a “hacker?”<br />
                    A: “Obsessive programming tinkerer.”<br />
                    4. According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled?<br />
                    A: 2 out of 3, or 66%<br />
                    5. Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?”<br />

                    Lou Montulli: Volunteer programer<br />
                    2. What is “Bugzilla?”<br />
                    A: A program that contains a list of all the unsolved or “open” bugs in their project, as well as all the programing tasks needed to complete the project.<br />
                    3. What is OSAF?<br />
                    A: Open Source Applications Foundation<br />
                    4. What is the projects’ name?<br />

                    8. What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”<br />
                    A: “An important problem we don’t have consensus on how to attack.”<br />
                    9. In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?<br />
                    A: The lateness of a software project.<br />
                    10. Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?<br />
                    A: The operating system for IBM System/360<br />
                    11. What is Brooks's Law?<br />
                    A: “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”<br />
                    12. Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?<br />
                    A: ⅙ of the time or 16.66%<br />
                   13. Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?<br />
                    A: “Half their time” or 50%<br />
                    14. Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?<br />
                    A: Only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.<br />
                    15. What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?<br />
                    A: The source code is the actual lines of code put into the computer to make the product, while the actual installed program is all in binary, unreadable and incomprehensible by almost anyone.<br />
                    16. What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?<br />
                    A: “Software anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that ‘closed’ software can’t match.”<br />
                    17. What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?<br />
                    A: Good programmers know what to write, Great programmers know what to rewrite/reuse/<br />
                    18. Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.<br />
                    A: Cathedral: A slowly and intentionally crafted structure by a singular or small group of programmers.<br />
                    19. Bazaar: a large disparate group of people all coming to the project with a series of different ideas and approaches.<br />
                    Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?<br />
                    A: Yes, in terms of the law being defined by the addition of more programmers, but it doesn't solve the central problem of not knowing how long a project will take to put out.<br />
                    20. What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?<br />
                    A: Andy’s input was to stop designing and start coding. The idea was to get going and get excited.<br />
                    <br />
                    Chapter 2<br />
                    1. Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain.<br />
                    A: He explained how open source software was like science. As in it’s about a large group of people actively sharing and building off each others ideas. While traditional software was like<br /> 
                    2. People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?<br />
                    A: It came from a program called “bootstrap loader” that helped get your OS running, which itself came from the term “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.”<br />
                    3. Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?<br />
                    A: at the Xerox Palo Alto research center.<br />
                    4. List three software project “train wrecks.”<br />
                    A: 
                    A software named “virtual case files developed as a larger product for the F.B.I. known as “Trilogy.”<br />
                    “Innovate,” an attempt by McDonalds to “turn the entire fast-food chain into a ‘real-time network.’<br />
                    “Everest” a procurement software for Ford.<br />
                    <br />
                    Chapter 3<br />
                    1. When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”  <br />
                    A: “Because you will almost never get it right the first time.”<br />
                    2. What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?<br />
                    A: A core dump is when the computer freezes to a halt, drops everything it's doing, and reports its exact memory at the moment of failure. “Core” refers to the memory banks of the earliest computers: wound wire coils known as “ferrite cores.”<br />
                    3. Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?<br />
                    A: “assembly language”<br />
                    4. Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?<br />
                    A: a “compiler”<br />
                    <br />
                    Chapter 4<br />
                    1. What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?<br />
                    A:  Front-end: all of the user facing software, including display, windows, mouses, and what and user inputs and outputs of data.<br />
                    Back-end: The process that the program uses to make sense of front end inputs and events so the computer can make sense of them, save them, and retrieve them.<br />
                    2. What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?<br />
                    A:  It refers to the idea that someday programs will be built completely out of reusable parts that will be much more easily put together.<br />
                    3. Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.<br />
                    A: Because software components, unlike lego bricks, can be vastly different sizes, connect to many more things, and can be taken apart and put together at very minute levels/<br />
                    <br />
                    Chapter 5<br />
                    1. What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.<br />
                    A: A software project can only be 2 of the following: Good, Fast, or Cheap.<br />
                    2. What is the more recent definition of “geek?”<br />
                    A: “The kind of person who finds it easier to have a relationship with computers than with other human beings.”<br />
                    3. What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?<br />
                    A: It means rewriting a chunk of code to be briefer, cleaner, and easier to read.<br />
                    4. What is “yak-shaving?”<br />
                    A: “A seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you’re working on.”<br />
                    <br />
                    Chapter 6<br />
                    1. What is term “edge cases” referring to in software development?<br />
                    A: When you’re not sure if it’s best to investigate, fix, or ignore very unlikely use cases.<br />
                    2. Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds advice about “large projects” given in 2004<br />
                    A: Don’t start large projects, start small ones, and it will possibly lead to a larger one.<br />
                    <br />
                    Chapter 7
                    1. Briefly describe Hungarian notation<br />
                    A: In Hungarian notation a programmer attaches a small prefix to all variable names, indicating what type of variable it is.<br />
                    2. What does the author state is the “...single most challenging demand of software development.”<br />
                    A: “Communicating abstractions unambiguously--from programmer to machine, from programmer to programmer, and from program to user.”<br />
