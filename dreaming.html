          <p class="blog-post-meta">by Ian McLuskie</p>
  
          <p>Below is a series of reading questions based off of the book Dreaming In Code by Scott Rosenburg:</p>
          <hr>
          <p>The following are guided reading questions:<br />
            Chapter 0<br />
            1. Who wrote “software is hard?” Who is that guy?<br />
            A: Donald Knuth<br />
            <br />
           2. Programmers start counting at what number?<br />
            A: Zero<br />
            <br />
            3. What was the original sense of a “hacker?”<br />
            A: “Obsessive programming tinkerer.”<br />
            <br />
            4. According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled?<br />

            <br />
            5. Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?”<br />

            Lou Montulli: Volunteer programer<br />
            <br />
            2. What is “Bugzilla?”<br />
            A: A program that contains a list of all the unsolved or “open” bugs in their project, as well as all the programing tasks needed to complete the project.<br />
            <br />
            3. What is OSAF?<br />
            A: Open Source Applications Foundation<br />
            <br />
            4. What is the projects’ name?<br />
            A: Chandler <br />
            <br />
            5. What will the software do?<br />

            <br />
            6. What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?<br />
            A: “scary”<br />
            <br />
            7. What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?<br />
            A: The impossibility of knowing how long it would take to fix<br />
            <br />
            8. What did Toy refer to as a “snake?”<br />
            A: “An important problem we don’t have consensus on how to attack.”<br />
            <br />
            9. In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?<br />
            A: The lateness of a software project.<br />
            <br />
            10. Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?<br />
            A: The operating system for IBM System/360<br />
            <br />
            11. What is Brooks's Law?<br />
            A: “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”<br />
            <br />
            12. Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?<br />
            A: ⅙ of the time or 16.66%<br />
            <br />
            13. Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?<br />
            A: “Half their time” or 50%<br />
            <br />
            14. Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?<br />
            A: Only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.<br /><br />

            15. What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?<br />
            A: The source code is the actual lines of code put into the computer to make the product, while the actual installed program is all in binary, unreadable and incomprehensible by almost anyone.<br />
            <br />
            16. What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?<br />
            A: “Software anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that ‘closed’ software can’t match.”<br />
            <br />
            17. What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?<br />
            A: Good programmers know what to write, Great programmers know what to rewrite/reuse/<br />
            <br />
            18. Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.<br />
            A: Cathedral: A slowly and intentionally crafted structure by a singular or small group of programmers.<br />
            <br />
            19. Bazaar: a large disparate group of people all coming to the project with a series of different ideas and approaches.<br />
            Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?<br />
            A: Yes, in terms of the law being defined by the addition of more programmers, but it doesn't solve the central problem of not knowing how long a project will take to put out.<br />
            <br />
            20. What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?<br />
            A: Andy’s input was to stop designing and start coding. The idea was to get going and get excited.<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 2<br />
            1. Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain.<br />
            A: He explained how open source software was like science. As in it’s about a large group of people actively sharing and building off each others ideas. While traditional software was like<br /> 
            <br />
            2. People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term?<br />
            A: It came from a program called “bootstrap loader” that helped get your OS running, which itself came from the term “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.”<br />
            <br />
            3. Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed?<br />
            A: at the Xerox Palo Alto research center.<br />
            <br />
            4. List three software project “train wrecks.”<br />
            A: 
            A software named “virtual case files developed as a larger product for the F.B.I. known as “Trilogy.”<br />
            “Innovate,” an attempt by McDonalds to “turn the entire fast-food chain into a ‘real-time network.’<br />
            “Everest” a procurement software for Ford.<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 3<br />
            1. When introducing a new technology or design, why did Frederick Brooks advise “plan to throw one away?”  <br />
            A: “Because you will almost never get it right the first time.”<br />
            <br />
            2. What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core?<br />
            A: A core dump is when the computer freezes to a halt, drops everything it's doing, and reports its exact memory at the moment of failure. “Core” refers to the memory banks of the earliest computers: wound wire coils known as “ferrite cores.”<br />
            <br />
            3. Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?<br />
            A: “assembly language”<br />
            <br />
            4. Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?<br />
            A: a “compiler”<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 4<br />
            1. What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?<br />
            A:  Front-end: all of the user facing software, including display, windows, mouses, and what and user inputs and outputs of data.<br />
            Back-end: The process that the program uses to make sense of front end inputs and events so the computer can make sense of them, save them, and retrieve them.<br />
            2. What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?<br />
            A:  It refers to the idea that someday programs will be built completely out of reusable parts that will be much more easily put together.<br />
            3. Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.<br />
            A: Because software components, unlike lego bricks, can be vastly different sizes, connect to many more things, and can be taken apart and put together at very minute levels/<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 5<br />
            1. What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome.<br />
            A: A software project can only be 2 of the following: Good, Fast, or Cheap.<br />
            <br />
            2. What is the more recent definition of “geek?”<br />
            A: “The kind of person who finds it easier to have a relationship with computers than with other human beings.”<br />
            <br />
            3. What does “refactoring” mean to programmers?<br />
            A: It means rewriting a chunk of code to be briefer, cleaner, and easier to read.<br />
            <br />
            4. What is “yak-shaving?”<br />
            A: “A seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you’re working on.”<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 6<br />
            1. What is term “edge cases” referring to in software development?<br />
            A: When you’re not sure if it’s best to investigate, fix, or ignore very unlikely use cases.<br />
            <br />
            2. Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds advice about “large projects” given in 2004<br />
            A: Don’t start large projects, start small ones, and it will possibly lead to a larger one.<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 7
            1. Briefly describe Hungarian notation<br />
            A: In Hungarian notation a programmer attaches a small prefix to all variable names, indicating what type of variable it is.<br />
            2. What does the author state is the “...single most challenging demand of software development.”<br />
            A: “Communicating abstractions unambiguously--from programmer to machine, from programmer to programmer, and from program to user.”<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 8<br />
            1. What does “eat your own dogfood” mean?<br />
            A: To “Eat your own dogfood” is to actively use the software project you’re working on. Using the beta software to organize all aspects of the business is, in Bill Gates words: “highly motivating.”<br />
            <br />
            2. Quote: “When people ask for numbers that far out, the traditional thing that engineers do ....” When discussing the timeline for Chandler, how was the quote above completed?<br />
            A: The full quote is “When people ask for numbers that far out, the traditional thing that engineers do is make them up.”<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 9<br />
            1. Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?<br />
            A: Structural programming evolved to address a large practice in the industry of creating extremely messy code, also known as “spaghetti code.” This “structure” often involved things like “subunits,” or “modules,” that acted as a much more concrete way of organization then was the industry standard at the time.<br />
            <br />
            2. Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?<br />
            A: While it helped improve conditions, and laid the groundwork for many ambitious projects in the future, over all it could never even touch the complexity of organizing developers and their work together.<br />
            <br />
            3. Have any techniques shown to improve the software development process?<br />
            A: The CMM method of much more rigid organizing worked for many projects, but due to the unique requirements for each individual project, the industry-wide ballooning of code requirements, and the general distaste that many programmers have for this more rigid structure, many project managers have found this process largely impractical as time goes on.<br />
            <br />
            4. The “waterfall model” of programming was/is popular. What were some problems with this model?<br />
            A: The first major problem was that with the inability to start on the next phase of a project without completing the first phase, leading many programmers sitting idle, and many delays in the project over all. The second main problem is that by doing this process it often means writing large chunks of code separately, and when put together it often ended in system collapse.<br />
            <br />
            5. What are the four tenets of Agile Software Development?<br />
            A: The four tenets of  “Agile Software Development” are:<br />
            Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br />
            Working software over comprehensive documentation<br />
            Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br />
            Responding to change over following a plan<br />
            <br />
            6. What did a 2004 study find about the development practices of some two hundred software team leaders?<br />
            A: The study found that the most dominant practice (reported by a full third of participants) was “none at all.”<br />
            <br />
            7. What is the “Joel Test” and what did he say about Microsoft and the Joel Test.<br />
            A: The “Joel Test” is a series of 12 questions involving practices and conditions being performed or not by an organization. These include questions ranging from “Do you have a bug database?” “Do you make daily builds?” and “Do programmers have quiet working conditions?” A score of 12 is perfect. Joel says that “companies like Microsoft run at 12 full time.”<br />
            <br />
            8. What is Rosenberg’s Law?<br />
            A: Rosenberg’s Law is: “Software is easy to make, except when you want it to do something new.” With the corollary being: “The only software that’s worth making is software that does something new.”<br />
            <br />
            Chapter 10<br />
            1. Chapter 10 is about the notion of “Software Engineering” and the difficulty of applying this label to the development of software. The author suggests that Yertle the Turtle provides an important lesson for programmers. Describe it.<br />
            A: Yertle the Turtle is a story in which a turtle king climbs on top of a very large turtle tower to survey his kingdom. Then, le lowliest turtle at the bottom of the stack burps. This then causes the entire tower of turtles to come falling down. This acts as a very good metaphor for programming. Often the languages and tools that programmers are working with are built on many, many layers of abstraction, and if some error occurs in one of the lower level layers it can often throw the whole system off.<br />
