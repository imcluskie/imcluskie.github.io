        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Software Is Hard Summary</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">by Ian McLuskie</p>

        <p>This is a summary of a blog post titled <a href="http://gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard">Software Is Hard</a> by Kyle Wilson. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software is hard. Wilson explores this idea by first looking at OSAFs development of Chandler as detailed in Scott Rosenberg's book “Dreaming in code.” The Chandler project seems defined by the lack of hard decisions in its development, leaving room for any and all suggestions and ideas to be implemented. This freedom caused the overall vision and purpose to waver significantly throughout its development. Another aspect that lead to its eventual downfall was too high ambition, leading to intense feature creep that made the whole project bigger and bigger as time went on. This comes down to one of the quintessential reasons software is hard: everything is possible, but the time, lines of code, and skill required to do something is completely unknowable before you start.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people don’t who don’t understand or want to ignore this problem try to create timelines for a specific project to be released, or try to quantify progress by using completely arbitrary metrics like “lines of code.” As an example, the company Fracture’s new game (as of the time the post was written) has an average of about 15 developers at any given time has written 825,000 lines of code in two years.  In comparison, it took 20 teams of developers eight years to write 750,000 lines of code for the first delivery of "Block 1" F-22. The purposes, type, problems, requirements, and solutions for each project were vastly different, so the manpower needs and size of the end product were as well.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilson compares software development with building bridges. Software often involves a repeated process of building something, seeing it fail, and building again. Once you know how to build a certain type of bridge, however, all you need to do is iterate the already well understood theme. Bridges involve predetermined principals that need to be executed well, while often software involves the process of inventing the principals in the first place-- a process that is impossible to quantify. The complexity of coding truly is something that stretches the human brain in ways we can’t comprehend.
